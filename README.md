Networking Adventures
Welcome to my Networking Adventures repository! I'm a third-year Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) student delving into networking concepts through hands-on projects and experiments.

Current Projects
UDP Socket Communication: Implemented a UDP server and client for local communication.
Network Protocol Analysis: Analyzing and simulating various network protocols and behaviors.
DNS Exploration: Investigating DNS name resolution and record types.
BitTorrent Simulation: Developing a basic BitTorrent-like file-sharing simulation.
This repository will be continuously updated as I explore the exciting world of networking. Stay tuned for more adventures! :)
