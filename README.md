Networking Adventures
Welcome to my Networking Adventures repository! I'm a third-year Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) student exploring various networking concepts through practical projects and experiments.

Current Projects
UDP Socket Communication: Implemented a UDP server and client for local communication.
Network Protocol Analysis: Analyzing and simulating different network protocols and behaviors.
DNS Exploration: Investigating DNS name resolution and record types.
BitTorrent Simulation: Developing a basic BitTorrent-like file-sharing simulation.

This repository is will continuously be under construction as i engage in the world of networking :)
